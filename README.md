## Advanced Features

### Piano Keyboard Interface
The built-in piano keyboard allows you to:
- **Click Keys**: Select individual notes by clicking on the visual piano
- **Build Chords**: Combine multiple notes to create custom chords
- **Preview Selection**: Play your selected notes instantly
- **Add to Progression**: Insert custom chords directly into your progression
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected notes are highlighted and displayed

### Chord Interaction
- **Clickable Progression**: Click any chord in the progression display to preview it
- **Rest Support**: Use `-` or `REST` to add silence/pauses in your progression
- **Live Preview**: Hear chords immediately without starting full playback
- **Drag and Drop**: Drag chords to rearrange them within your progression
- **Adjustable Time Signature**: Change between 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 6/8, and 8/8 time signatures
- **Measure-Based Display**: Chords are organized into measures with clear visual separation
- **Right-click Context Menu**: Right-click on chords for edit, duplicate, substitute, and delete options
- **Double-click Editing**: Double-click any chord to edit it directly
- **Transpose Tools**: Transpose entire progressions up or down by semitones
- **Import/Export**: Save and load progressions as JSON files or text format
- **Chord Substitution**: Get intelligent chord substitution suggestions
- **Visual Indicators**: See chord functions, note names, and edit status
- **Empty Slot Insertion**: Add placeholder chords for easier progression building

### Just Intonation
When enabled, Just Intonation mode adjusts chord intervals to use pure harmonic ratios:
- **Major Third**: 5:4 ratio (14 cents flatter than equal temperament)
- **Perfect Fifth**: 3:2 ratio (2 cents sharper than equal temperament)
- **Minor Third**: 6:5 ratio (slightly different from equal temperament)

This creates more consonant, "in-tune" harmonies that are easier on the ear and better for ear training.

### Timing and Synchronization
- Uses Web Audio API for precise timing
- Chord changes are scheduled in advance to avoid timing drift
- Metronome clicks are synchronized with the main beat
